``pyhigh`` is a Python package for accessing elevation data, which is retrieved from a [USGS dataset](https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/North_America/).  The package uses caching to avoid unecessary downloads from the USGS dataset, but please respect their download policies.

## Installation

```shell
> pip install pyhigh
```

## Usage

### Command-line utility

The ``pyhigh`` Python package includes a command-line tool of the same name to retreive the elevation at a particular latitude and longitude:

```shell
> pyhigh --lat 36.52011 --lon -118.671
1884
```

As necessary, files will be download from a USGS dataset and cache in the folder ``pyhigh/pyhigh/.cache``.  To clear this cache, use the ``--clean`` argument:

```shell
> pyhigh --clean
```

### Python API

The ``get_elevation`` function returns the elevation, in meters, at the given latitude and longitude.

```python
>>> from pyhigh import get_elevation
>>> get_elevation(lat=36.52011, lon=-118.671)
1884
```

It is also possible to request a bunch elevations for a bunch of latitudes and longitudes at once.  The result returned is a NumPy array of elevations.

```python
>>> from pyhigh import get_elevation_batch
>>> get_elevation_batch([(36.52011, -118.671),
...                      (36.62011, -118.771)])
array([1884., 2438.])
```
This is more efficient than individual calls to ``get_elevation`` because elevation reads are pooled together to avoid reading the same ``*.hgt`` file multiple times.

Finally, the ``pyhigh`` cache of ``*.hgt`` files can be cleared with the API function ``clear_cache``:

```python
>>> from pyhigh import clear_cache
>>> clear_cache()
```
